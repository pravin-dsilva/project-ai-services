# Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing and configuring AI-services on a RHEL environment.
Before you begin, confirm that all prerequisites are satisfied.

## Prerequisites

- HMC-based access (UI and/or CLI)

- Spyre cards are attached, discoverable, and ACTIVATED (x cards)

- Podman is installed and running

- Hardware - 1 LPAR (16 CPUs (NUMA aligned), 768GB RAM, 600GB Storage) // check with the team once


## Installation

### Pull in the go binary

Download the latest `ai-services` binary from the [releases page](some link should live here).

Use the following `curl` command to download it (replace `<version>` with the desired release tag):

```bash
curl -LO https://example.com/ai-services/releases/download/<version>/<ai-services-binary>
```

### Run the binary to get started

```bash
